# Community Software Analysis Proposal
In cooperation with Christina Wang

## Software: Gridap.jl

Gridap is a set of tools written in Julia. It allows a user to get an approximate solution to a PDE under various conditions such as unusual domains, multi-fields etc. It employs finite element methods. One of the prominent features is the ability to set up equations as they appear mathematically. This seems to reduce the number of code lines. The audience appears to be researchers who are familiar with mathematical frameworks (e.g. weak-form solutions) and need to solve their problems under above mentioned restrictions.

### Notes/concerns/risks

As for now, based on their tutorial pages, GRIDAP is the most appropriate for single Poisson-like equations. We are not yet sure which PDE could be appropriate to test on. For pull requests, the content must follow the provided format. There are a lot of issues and help needed (at the same time, those seem to be advanced), so we are not yet sure if anything will run smoothly.
